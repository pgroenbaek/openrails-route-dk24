# Contribution guidelines

contributions to this route are very welcome

## track/road contributions

Only sections of new tracks/roads that have not been built yet are accepted as contributions to the track and road layout.

### New sections of tracks/roads
When building the new section please make an entirely new empty route and build the perticular section of new tracks/roads there.
This makes it easy to merge the new sections into the existing DK24 route in the TSRE5 editor.

Create an issue tagged with "Contribution of new tracks/roads section"

### Improvements to the existing tracks/roads

If you want to contribute small changes to the tracks/roads you'll need to submit an request instead, so that the changes can be made in the existing route.

In OpenRails tracks/roads are stored as a complex data structure in text files.

Letting git merge these small track/road changes will corrupt that data structure.

And merging the small changes is very cumbersome to do by hand.
